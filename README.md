Introduction:-
This project leverages innovative Deep learning models and Django framework symptoms based disease prediction. It also provides detailed information about the top predicted diseases, including chat with the doctor.
The model which performed best was Sequential Model with SoftMax Activation Function whit accuracy of 97.66% and we build prediction model on this for further usage in Django framework for UI integration. 
We're trying to predict all sorts of diseases like Fungal infection, AllergyÂ¸ Diabetes, etc.
covering a wide range of health issues. By studying different symptoms like Itching, Skin
rash, Nodal skin Eruptions, etc. our model learns how to tell disease possibility from it. This system is designed to be accessible and useful even to individuals with limited medical knowledge. It can assist in early disease detection and diagnosis, providing users with an initial understanding of the severity of their condition. 

Background:-
In healthcare, spotting diseases early is crucial. This project uses machine learning to
predict diseases based on symptoms. We used CSV files, which contain a dataset with lots
of symptoms and diseases. Our model, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Sequential Model with SoftMax activation function, looks at these symptoms to find
patterns and identify diseases early.
After lots of training and testing, our model can predict diseases with an impressive
accuracy of 97.66%. But it's not just about finding diseases. To make this process accessible and user-friendly, we have designed a user interface (UI) that simplifies interaction with the model. Through this interface, users can input their symptoms, and the model provides predictions about potential diseases. Moreover, users have the option to connect with healthcare professionals for further guidance and treatment.
This project breaks new ground by utilizing symptom-based data for disease prediction, aiming to detect illnesses earlier and expedite treatment. Through the integration of advanced technology, comprehensive symptom data, and a user-friendly interface (UI), our goal is to enhance healthcare accessibility and outcomes for all.

Dataset Used:-
For that we have used the Kaggle dataset which is publicly available for the usage.
